## CryptoParty Handouts
These handouts are developed with the intent that they be distributed alongside accompanying practical demonstrations at our CryptoParties. They may therefore be missing some of the information that we intend to cover directly at the events. You may want to consider adding some of this information back in if you intend to distribute these flyers without an accompanying demonstration.

Additionally, these flyers are formatted with the intent that they be printed on a greyscale laser printer so they're not as glamorous as they perhaps could be. If you use these assets to make more glamorous colour versions for your purposes please do let us know!

Some of these handouts use adapted text or images from the Electronic Frontier Foundation's [Surveillance Self Defence](https://ssd.eff.org/) project. We provide these templates and documents with thanks to them for their materials.

As always, if you do anything cool with these we would love to hear from you! Let us know on Twitter at [@ORGNorthEast](https://twitter.com/ORGNorthEast).
