## CryptoParty Newcastle Handouts

#### About
These handouts are developed with the intent that they be distributed alongside accompanying practical demonstrations at our CryptoParties. They may therefore be missing some of the information that we intend to cover directly at the events. You may want to consider adding some of this information back in if you plan on distributing these without the accompanying practical demonstration.

We formatted these handouts intending to print them on a mono laser printer, so they're not as glamorous as they perhaps could be. If you use these assets to make more glamorous colour versions for your purposes please do let us know!

#### Credits
* Some of these handouts use adapted text or images from the Electronic Frontier Foundation's [Surveillance Self Defence](https://ssd.eff.org/) project. We provide these templates and documents with thanks to them for their materials.
* Many thanks to [Karl Birrane](https://twitter.com/karlbirrane) for the original handout design templates found here.
