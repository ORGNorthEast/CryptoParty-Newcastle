# cryptopartynewcastle.org

This is where the config lives for the CryptoParty [main site](https://cryptopartynewcastle.org/) and [forum](https://forum.cryptopartynewcastle.org/). It serves a dual-purpose here - a useful central repository of configuration for easy deployment/migration, and as an effort in transparency. Please feel free to browse through this section and learn from it, or suggest improvements.

To suggest improvements or point out something we're doing wrong, you should probably contact `alex@alexhaydock.co.uk`.
