#      Suppressions by Rule (All Hosts Are Affected)       #
############################################################

## Loads of Tor relays run on FTP ports. Suppressing these
## alerts suppressess most of the alerts I was getting
## in my log that were from Tor relays:
#(ftp_telnet) Invalid FTP Command
suppress gen_id 125, sig_id 2
#(ftp_telnet) FTP response message was too long
suppress gen_id 125, sig_id 6
#(ftp_telnet) Evasive (incomplete) TELNET CMD on FTP Command Channel
suppress gen_id 125, sig_id 9

## Suppress some alerts triggered mostly by Tor relays that are
## running on HTTP ports (80, 8080, etc)
#(http_inspect) NO CONTENT-LENGTH OR TRANSFER-ENCODING IN HTTP RESPONSE
suppress gen_id 120, sig_id 3
#(http_inspect) BARE BYTE UNICODE ENCODING
suppress gen_id 119, sig_id 4
#(http_inspect) UNESCAPED SPACE IN HTTP URI
suppress gen_id 119, sig_id 33
#(http_inspect) INVALID CONTENT-LENGTH OR CHUNK SIZE
suppress gen_id 120, sig_id 8

## For some reason this rule seems to be mostly triggered by FreeBSD's
## portsnap upgrades... I don't know why, but I doubt it's much use anyway.
#(http_inspect) TOO MANY PIPELINED REQUESTS
suppress gen_id 119, sig_id 34

## This one will suppress alerts caused by Tor relays running on POP3
## ports. No major concern, since I'm not going to be running any POP3
## services myself.
#(POP) Unknown POP3 command
suppress gen_id 142, sig_id 1

## This one will suppress alerts caused by Tor relays running on IMAP
## ports. No major concern, since I'm not going to be running any IMAP
## services myself.
#(IMAP) Unknown IMAP4 command
suppress gen_id 141, sig_id 1
#(IMAP) Unknown IMAP4 response
suppress gen_id 141, sig_id 2

## Suppress alerts for Tor relays running on SSH ports. I don't really
## like this one much, but I'm never going to run SSH on port 22, so
## there's not too much harm in it.
#(spp_ssh) Protocol mismatch
suppress gen_id 128, sig_id 4

## These alerts are to do with inspected HTTP traffic, but seem to
## get triggered a bit too easily leading to overzealous blocking.
#(http_inspect) DOUBLE DECODING ATTACK
suppress gen_id 119, sig_id 2

## Some Tor relays run on Telnet ports too. Not too many though,
## so I'm suppressing them on a case-by-case basis.
#(ftp_telnet) Telnet Subnegotiation Begin Command without Subnegotiation End
suppress gen_id 126, sig_id 3, track by_src, ip 81.171.7.131
suppress gen_id 126, sig_id 3, track by_dst, ip 81.171.7.131
#(ftp_telnet) Telnet Subnegotiation Begin Command without Subnegotiation End
suppress gen_id 126, sig_id 3, track by_src, ip 176.10.99.206
suppress gen_id 126, sig_id 3, track by_dst, ip 176.10.99.206

## Suppress alerts for the small number of Tor relays using SMTP ports
## There really aren't many of these, so I'm tracking them individually.
#(smtp) Attempted response buffer overflow
suppress gen_id 124, sig_id 3, track by_src, ip 23.254.165.250
suppress gen_id 124, sig_id 3, track by_dst, ip 23.254.165.250
#(smtp) Attempted response buffer overflow
suppress gen_id 124, sig_id 3, track by_src, ip 213.153.84.215
suppress gen_id 124, sig_id 3, track by_dst, ip 213.153.84.215

## This relay runs on SIP ports, triggering some alerts caused by
## it sending Tor traffic instead of SIP traffic.
#(spp_sip) URI is too long
suppress gen_id 140, sig_id 3, track by_src, ip 37.59.61.192
suppress gen_id 140, sig_id 3, track by_dst, ip 37.59.61.192
